# PCOS Detection in Ultrasound Images via Deep Learning and CNNs
## Abstract:
This project presents a study on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning to classify ovarian ultrasound images into healthy and infected cases. The datasets used in the study consisted of healthy ovaries and ovaries with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). A pre-trained DenseNet201 model was fine-tuned for use on these datasets, and the performance of the model on both datasets was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall as the metrics. The results of the study showed that the proposed method was able to achieve a somewhat satisfactory accuracy of 70% on the test set. The study highlights the potential of using transfer learning to improve the performance of CNNs in medical imaging tasks and the importance of the quality of the dataset in achieving better and accurate results. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on the application of deep learning in medical imaging and has the potential to be applied to other medical imaging tasks.
